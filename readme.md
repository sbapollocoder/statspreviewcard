## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass

### What I learned

- Used Sass via github.io and on local development machine with watch mode
- Continued looking at media queries
- Changing image colours

### Continued development

- Want to make it more responsive so that it more seamlessly breaks into the mobile site rather than being quite a harsh transition at a fixed coordinate
